# Project Milestones: OpenClaw Optimization

## v1.0 OpenClaw Optimization (Shipped: 2026-02-02)

**Delivered:** Solved context overflow problem and built cost-saving infrastructure with three-tier routing (Ollama/MiniMax/Claude), security hardening, and multi-agent preparation.

**Phases completed:** 1-7 (21 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Fork established with upstream tracking for safe development
- ACTIVE.md hot context pattern prevents context loss during compaction
- Ollama local inference with qwen2.5:3b + nomic-embed-text embeddings
- GPG vault + macOS Keychain for secure credential storage
- Delegation brief system for structured sub-agent coordination
- Three-tier cost routing (Ollama free / MiniMax cheap / Claude quality)
- Multi-agent patterns documented for future fleet deployment

**Stats:**

- 21 plans, ~100 tasks
- ~29,713 lines TypeScript
- 7 phases over 3 days (2026-01-30 to 2026-02-02)
- 5 brain-docs concept files created

**Git range:** `c8f3eba` (initial) → `ba76746` (final docs)

**What's next:** Multi-agent fleet deployment (v2.0) — deploy 2-3 agents with Mission Control infrastructure per Bhanu's guide.
